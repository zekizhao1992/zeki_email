     * This method throws NullPointerExceptions when either argument to the method
     * is null -- this may or may not be by design.
     * 
     * 'startsWith' also throws a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when 'str' is a
     * string with less length than 'match' - this is most definitely a software
     * exception.
     * 
     * A method should be able to handle null arguments gracefully, declare
     * preconditions that the method does not expect null arguments from the caller,
     * or in the least, it should document that nullpointer exceptions are possible.
     * 
     * Developers must consider the cases when exceptions could happen in the code.
     * Especially code in the public api.
     * 
     * @param str
     *            the string we want to search in
     * @param match
     *            the substring we're searching for
     * @return true if 'str' starts with 'match', false otherwise.
     * 
     *         Finding the set of arguments that cause software exceptions is hard
     *         if done by hand but is easy for Jtest. It will test tirelessly and
     *         will never get bored of testing.
