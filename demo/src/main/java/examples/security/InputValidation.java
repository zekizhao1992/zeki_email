/**
 * <p>
 * This example shows how enforcing BD.SECURITY.VPPD: ("Encapsulate all
 * dangerous data returning methods with a validation function") helps to
 * definitely secure an application from dangerous inputs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main security vulnerability in this code is that the username and
 * password entered by the user are not validated. This is very dangerous, for
 * example anybody entering <code>"a' OR 'a' = 'a"</code> as username and
 * password would be authorized.
 * </p>
 * To go over this example perform the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Run "Security Assessment" on this file. Note that the security
 * vulnerability is reported by both BD.SECURITY.TDSQL and BD.SECURITY.VPPD.
 * BD.SECURITY.TDSQL tell us that tainted data originates in the
 * <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and propagates without being validate to the
 * SQL statement. BD.SECURITY.VPPD tell us that <code>HttpServletRequest</code>
 * is returning tainted data that is not encapsulated by a validating
 * method.</li>
 * <li>Fix the problem reported by uncommenting the <code>PARTIAL FIX</code> in
 * the <code>authorize()</code> method.</li>
 * <li>Rerun "Security Assessment".</li>
 * </ol>
 * Note that the BD.SECURITY.TDSQL errors are no longer reported, but the
 * BD.SECURITY.VPPD errors are still reported. One could leave the code as it is
 * as the fix successfully prevents any attack on the existing code. To see how
 * this could be a problem imagine that later on somebody does the code change
 * in <code>CODE ENHANCEMENT</code> in <code>doGet()</code>. After that change
 * the code would be vulnerable to an attack again. A user would still not be
 * able to get authorized by just entering <code>"a' OR 'a' = 'a"</code> as the
 * previous fix would prevent that, but somebody could instead enter
 * <code>"hacker"</code> for username and
 * <code>"unknown'; DELETE FROM Accounts; --"</code> for password and completely
 * delete the "Accounts" table (or any other table) from the database.
 * <p>
 * A more general fix is the one shown in <code>DEFINITIVE FIX</code> in
 * <code>doGet()</code>, the input is validated as soon as it enters the code
 * and before it starts propagating through different paths.
 * </p>
